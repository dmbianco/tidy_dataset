# UCI HAR Dataset

## The dataset includes the following files:


- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

#### Brief description of the variables

```
- subject: the subject ID
- activity: 6 types of activity perfomed from the subject („walking“, "walking_upstairs" , "walking_downstairs" , "sitting" ,  "standing" ,  "laying“) 
- t : time domain signal
- f : frequency domain signal
- Body : measuring the body acceleration signal
- Gravity : measuring the gravity acceleration  signal 
- Acc: signal coming from an accelerometer
- Gyro : signal coming from a gyroscope
- Jerk : derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
- Mag : magnitude calculated using Euclidean norm
- Mean : Mean value
- Std : Standard Deviation
- XYZ : is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
